# StringOffsetUtility
This is the String Utility that manipulates the String based on the Offset provided.
This encodes the provided String according to the offset provided. All non-character symbols are not modified.

Example:
If the offset is 1 then all 'a' letters are replaced with 'b', 'b' with 'c', etc.
If the offset is -1 then all 'a' letters are replaced with 'z', 'b' with 'a', etc.
